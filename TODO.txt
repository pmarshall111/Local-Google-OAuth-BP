- add deletion routes
- date splitting so that if the start date of a time is before the finish date of a target, but the
time goes on for longer than the target, we split the time spent to 2 targets

- need a way of auto generating a new target when the old one expires. perhaps a cronjob to ping
the server every minute?

- think about how to calculate stats. do we want to calculate it on the backend, or just send all the
data to the frontend and let the client figure it out?
